# Testing

- Always use vitest for tests
- If testing a file (i.e. unit tests), create files in the name <file>.spec.ts
  - e.g. my-file.ts would have a test file called my-file.spec.ts
- When creating integration tests, they should be in the format something.test.ts
- Error variables can be named e or err, but never error
