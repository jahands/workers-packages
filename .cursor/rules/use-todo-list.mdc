**TODO List Management Rule:**

You must maintain a TODO.md file to track all pending tasks, improvements, and known issues in the codebase. Follow these guidelines:

**File Location:**

- The file should go in the package directory we're working on. E.g. apps/some-app/TODO.md

**File Format:**

- Use standard markdown with `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks
- Organize tasks under clear section headers (e.g., ## Features, ## Bug Fixes, ## Refactoring)
- Include brief descriptions and priority levels (High/Medium/Low) in parentheses

**When to Update:**

- **Add items** when you identify new tasks, bugs, or improvements needed
- **Mark complete** when you finish implementing a task
- **Update descriptions** when task scope changes
- **Remove obsolete** items that are no longer relevant

**What to Track:**

- Features to implement
- Bugs to fix
- Code refactoring needs
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimizations
- Security improvements
- Testing requirements

**Example Format:**

```markdown
# TODO

## High Priority

- [ ] Fix authentication bug in login flow (High)
- [ ] Add error handling for API calls (High)

## Features

- [ ] Implement user profile page (Medium)
- [x] Add search functionality (Medium)

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor database queries for better performance (Low)
```

**Always show me the updated TODO.md content after making changes to code or when I ask for project status.**

This rule ensures the LLM consistently tracks work while providing you with clear visibility into project progress and outstanding tasks.
