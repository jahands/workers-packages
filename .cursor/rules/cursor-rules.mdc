# Cursor Rules - Organization and Format

## Location
All cursor rules should be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory with the `.mdc` extension.

❌ Do NOT create:
- `.cursorrules` file in the root (deprecated)
- Rules in other locations
- Rules with other extensions

✅ DO create:
- `.cursor/rules/{descriptive-name}.mdc`
- One rule per file
- Clear, focused rules

## File Naming
- Use kebab-case: `my-rule-name.mdc`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Group related rules with common prefixes

Examples:
- `github-actions-runners.mdc`
- `docker-compose.mdc`
- `development-workflow.mdc`

## Rule Format
Rules should be written in Markdown with this structure:

```markdown
# Title - Brief Description

## Context/Location
Where this rule applies (files, directories, etc.)

### Overview/Architecture
High-level explanation of the system/pattern

### Key Concepts
Important points to understand

### Usage/Patterns
How to apply the rule

### Examples
Clear, concrete examples
```

## Best Practices
- Focus on describing patterns rather than providing static templates
- Let LLMs learn from existing code when possible
- Keep rules focused and single-purpose
- Update rules when patterns significantly change
- Remove rules that become obsolete

## Current Rules
Reference the existing rules in `.cursor/rules/` for examples of proper formatting and organization:
- `monorepo-structure.mdc`
- `development-workflow.mdc`
- `cli-tools.mdc`
- `docker-compose.mdc`
- `server-management.mdc`
- `github-actions-runners.mdc`
