# http-codex

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- bdbe259: fix: remove hono from packages that don't need it
- bfac029: feat: add http-codex package

  I love using Go's http package for status codes and always find myself missing it in TypeScript projects. This project aims to be a lightweight adaption of Go's [http status codes](https://go.dev/src/net/http/status.go).

  Enjoy!
