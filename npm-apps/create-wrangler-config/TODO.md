# TODO

- [x] make sanitizeWorkerName() error if sanitization fails / returns empty name
- [x] make detectPackageManager() async
- [x] WorkerName schema should ensure name does not start or end with a hyphen
- [x] Auto-install wrangler as a dev dependency instead of asking the user
- [x] Install dependencies after all prompts are complete instead of doing it at the beginning
