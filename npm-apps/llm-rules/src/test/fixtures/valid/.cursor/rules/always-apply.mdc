- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused (max 20 lines)
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent file and folder naming
- Include proper imports and exports

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Include README files for major components
- Document complex business logic
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

## Testing

- Write tests for all public functions
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies properly
